# Saigon-Sans-Novus

Is developed from: https://github.com/bettergui/BeVietnamPro

Changes include: imported 1 and 7 from alternative glyphs, reduced default leading, make posture multiplexed
(so roman and italic share same widths), changed italic angle from 12 to 15 degrees,
and added some Latin support.
